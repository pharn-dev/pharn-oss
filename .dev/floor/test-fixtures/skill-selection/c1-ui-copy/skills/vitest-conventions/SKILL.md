# Vitest conventions

- Tests sit next to the code: `Thing.tsx` is tested by `Thing.test.tsx`.
- Render components with `renderWithProviders()` from `src/test/render.tsx`, never bare `render()`.
- Query by role (`getByRole`) before text; never by class name.
- Snapshot files under `__snapshots__/` are never edited by hand. Change the component, run `npx vitest -u <test file>`, and review the snapshot diff in the PR.
- No `test.only` or `describe.only` is committed.
