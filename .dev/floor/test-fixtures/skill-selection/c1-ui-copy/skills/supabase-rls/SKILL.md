# Supabase row-level security

- Every table enables RLS in the migration that creates it.
- Policies are named `<table>_<action>_<role>`.
- Use `auth.uid()` to match the row owner. Never write `using (true)`.
- Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` and are generated with `supabase migration new`.
