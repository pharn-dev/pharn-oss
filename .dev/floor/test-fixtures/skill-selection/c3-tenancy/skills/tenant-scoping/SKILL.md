description: Multi-tenant data access rules for this SaaS — how every query is scoped to the caller's organization. Use for any code that reads or writes customer data.

# Tenant scoping

- Every query on customer data goes through `withTenant(session)`, which adds `orgId = session.orgId`.
- Never accept an `orgId` from request params, query strings or bodies.
- A record that exists but belongs to another organization is answered with 404, never 403, so ids cannot be probed.
